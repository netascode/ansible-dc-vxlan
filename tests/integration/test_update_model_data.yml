# This playbook will update the service model data under tests/integration/host_vars
# with real data from file tests/integration/fabric_vars.yml

# Instructions for using this playbook:
#
# 1. Copy
#        * tests/integration/fabric_vars_example.yml to
#        * tests/integration/fabric_vars.yml
#
#        and
#
#        * tests/integration/test_inventory_example.yml to
#        * tests/integration/test_inventory.yml
#
# 2. Update the tests/integration/fabric_vars.yml file with the real data
#
# 3. Update the tests/integration/test_inventory.yml file with the NDFC IP address information
#
# 4. Run the playbook with the following command:
#    ansible-playbook -i test_inventory.yml test_update_model_data.yml
#
# This will create 3 new directories under tests/integration/host_vars:
# - fabric_empty
# - fabric_full_large
# - fabric_full_small
#
# It will copy the content from tests/integration/host_vars/examples/fabric_* to the new directories
# and replace the placeholders with the real data from tests/integration/fabric_vars.yml
