# Note about using ansible-vault to encrypt sensitive data
# --------------------------------------------------------
# 1) Create a file named 'vault_password_file' and add the vault password in it in clear text.
#    This is a file you control and should never be checked into source control.
#
# 2) Run the following command to encrypt a specific variable like 'ndfc_switch_password' above:
#    ansible-vault encrypt_string --vault-password-file ./vault_password_file 'super_secret_password' --name 'ndfc_switch_password'
#
# 3) Copy the encrypted string and replace the original value with it.
#
# It will look somoething like this:
# ndfc_switch_password: !vault |
#           $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
